# Feature Specification: Azure DevOps Integration Agent

## Overview
This feature spec outlines the development of an AI agent capable of autonomously completing Azure DevOps tasks by reading task details, implementing required changes in the specified repository, testing the implementation, and creating pull requests.

## Background
Development teams often have many small tasks that require routine code changes across repositories. These tasks consume developer time that could be better spent on complex problems. An AI agent that can autonomously handle these tasks would significantly improve team productivity.

## Agent Capabilities

### 1. Task Interpretation
- Read and parse Azure DevOps task details including:
  - Task description and requirements
  - Target repository information
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Related work items or dependencies
- Extract key information to understand the scope of changes needed

### 2. Repository Interaction
- Clone/access the specified repository
- Navigate repository structure to locate relevant files
- Understand the codebase architecture and patterns
- Make appropriate code changes based on task requirements

### 3. Implementation
- Write code that meets the requirements specified in the task
- Follow existing code style and patterns in the repository
- Support implementation in any programming language found in the repository
- Detect and match language-specific idioms and design patterns
- Add appropriate comments and documentation in language-appropriate style
- Handle edge cases and implement error handling
- Apply language-specific best practices for performance and maintainability

### 4. Testing
- Run existing unit tests to verify changes don't break existing functionality
- Create new unit tests for added functionality using appropriate language-specific testing frameworks
- Support all major testing frameworks across languages:
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, Cypress
  - Python: pytest, unittest, nose
  - Java: JUnit, TestNG, Mockito
  - C#: NUnit, xUnit, MSTest
  - And others as detected in the repository
- Fix build issues that arise during implementation
- Identify and address logical issues or edge cases
- Perform integration testing when applicable
- Use language-appropriate mocking and stubbing techniques

### 5. Pull Request Creation
- Create a properly formatted pull request in Azure DevOps
- Include a descriptive PR title with task number and "Done by AI Agent" indicator
- Write a comprehensive PR description including:
  - Summary of changes implemented
  - Testing performed
  - Any issues encountered and how they were resolved
  - References to the original task
- Add appropriate reviewers based on repository ownership

## User Workflows

### Workflow 1: Standard Task Completion
1. User assigns a task to the AI agent in Azure DevOps
2. Agent reads task details and identifies required repository
3. Agent clones/accesses the repository
4. Agent implements necessary changes
5. Agent runs tests and fixes any issues
6. Agent creates a pull request with proper documentation
7. User receives notification of completed PR

### Workflow 2: Complex Task Requiring Clarification
1. User assigns a task to the AI agent
2. Agent reads task but identifies ambiguities or missing information
3. Agent creates a comment on the task requesting clarification
4. User provides additional information
5. Agent proceeds with implementation, testing, and PR creation
6. User receives notification of completed PR

### Workflow 3: Task with Build Issues
1. User assigns a task to the AI agent
2. Agent implements changes but encounters build issues
3. Agent diagnoses and resolves build problems
4. Agent documents the build issues and their resolution in the PR
5. User receives notification of completed PR with details about resolved issues

## Technical Requirements

### Azure DevOps Integration
- Authentication to Azure DevOps services
- API access to read task details
- Permission to create PRs and comment on tasks
- Access to repository history and structure

### Repository Access
- Git operations (clone, branch, commit)
- Repository-specific build and test tools
- Ability to run CI pipelines locally

### Multi-Language Support
- Support for all major programming languages including but not limited to:
  - JavaScript/TypeScript
  - Python
  - Java
  - C#/.NET
  - Go
  - Ruby
  - PHP
  - Rust
  - Swift
  - C/C++
- Ability to detect language-specific patterns and idioms
- Support for popular frameworks within each language:
  - Web frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, ASP.NET, Django, Rails, etc.)
  - Testing frameworks (Jest, pytest, JUnit, NUnit, etc.)
  - ORM libraries
  - Cloud provider SDKs
- Language-appropriate documentation styles
- Understanding of language-specific package managers and build systems

### Development Environment
- Containerized environment with necessary build tools
- Language-specific SDKs and compilers
- Testing frameworks
- IDE tooling integration for code analysis

### Security Considerations
- Limited access scope to only assigned repositories
- Audit logging of all agent actions
- Secure credential management
- Analysis for secure coding practices in each language

## Pull Request Format

## Additional Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Cross-Repository Dependencies
The agent may need to understand dependencies between repositories to implement a task correctly. In this case, the agent should:
1. Identify dependent repositories
2. Analyze dependencies to understand impact
3. Note dependencies in the PR description
4. Suggest additional changes required in other repositories

### Scenario 2: Performance Optimization Tasks
For tasks focused on performance improvements:
1. Run performance benchmarks before changes
2. Implement optimizations
3. Run benchmarks after changes
4. Include performance comparison in PR description

### Scenario 3: Feature Flag Implementation
For new features that require feature flags:
1. Implement code with appropriate feature flag controls
2. Test both enabled and disabled states
3. Document feature flag configuration in PR
4. Provide instructions for enabling the feature in different environments

## Success Metrics
- Percentage of tasks successfully completed without human intervention
- Average time to complete tasks compared to human developers
- Number of PRs requiring revision after submission
- Code quality metrics on submitted PRs

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-repository support for changes spanning multiple codebases
- Integration with code review feedback to improve future implementations
- Learning from repository patterns to improve code quality over time
- Support for more complex architectural changes
- Addition of new programming languages and frameworks as they emerge
- Enhanced language-specific static analysis
- Support for specialized domains (embedded systems, mobile development, etc.)
- Advanced refactoring capabilities across all supported languages
